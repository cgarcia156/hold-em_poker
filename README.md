# Poker Game

This is a poker game implemented in Python using Pygame.
The game is based on the Texas Hold 'Em variant of poker.
The player starts with a balance of $1000 and can bet any amount within their balance.
The game follows the standard rules of Texas Hold 'Em poker,
with the player being dealt two cards and then being given the option to check, bet, or fold.
The game continues with the flop, turn, and river being dealt and the player being given the 
opportunity to bet or fold after each round.
The player's hand is compared to the dealer's hand at the end of the river and the player
wins if their hand is higher.
